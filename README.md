From Kaggle's Beata Faron, 'FMCG Daily Sals Data (2022-2024)

I'll post below their 'about dataset' after I add my own comments and goals in using this dataset.

In preperation for my upcoming consulting business in a variety of things, I want to code fresh pieces of material, demonstrating prowess
in thoughtfulness, analysis, and order. So, this looks like a promising dataset with over 190k entries over three years - we should
be able to do a lot with it. Unfortunately the data is syntheic, yet the process of observing whatever remains the same and should be more
than adequate in demonstating my abilities to potential clients.

My various comments themselves will be slightly more professional, hopefullly, than my default in the git platform.

From Kaggle:
